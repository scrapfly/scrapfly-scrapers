      "reviewLikes": "I really like how straightforward DigitalOcean is. Setting up a Droplet (their virtual server) takes just a few clicks, and the interface is clean enough that I never feel lost. The pricing is transparent-no hidden costs-and starts low enough to fit small projects or startups. Another plus is their huge library of community tutorials and guides, which makes solving issues a lot easier.",
      "reviewDislikes": "Sometimes the support response time can be slow, especially during busy periods. I’ve also learned to keep extra backups, as I once had a managed database update cause some data loss. And while it’s perfect for simple to medium-scale projects, it lacks some of the advanced features you’d get from bigger cloud providers."

      "reviewLikes": "DigitalOcean is simply exceptional for its minimalist approach that doesn't sacrifice functionality. What I like the most:Simplicity without compromises: The interface is incredibly clean and intuitive. In minutes you can have a droplet running, without unnecessary complex configurations.Transparent pricing: There are no surprises in billing. You know exactly what you pay for what you use, without hidden costs or confusing pricing structures like other providers.Exceptional documentation: Their tutorials and guides are clear, direct, and really useful. The community and educational content are top-notch.Consistent performance: The droplets have predictable and reliable performance. The SSDs and network work exactly as you expect.Developer-friendly: Perfect for developers who want to focus on building, not struggling with infrastructure. The APIs are simple and well-documented.",
      "reviewDislikes": "Fewer enterprise services: Compared to AWS or Azure, it has fewer specialized services. But honestly, this is also part of its minimalist charm.Limited support in basic plans: Premium technical support requires more expensive plans, although the documentation makes up for this a lot."

      "reviewDislikes": "There’s not much to dislike, but if I had to point something out, it would be that some advanced features and monitoring tools are more limited compared to larger cloud providers like AWS or GCP. While that keeps things simpler, power users might miss certain enterprise-grade options or integrations. That said, for the vast majority of use cases, DigitalOcean more than delivers."

For instance, you can create a vps host (with 1cpu and 10gb hard disk) for as little as $4 per month. It can go all the way up to $1630/mo with 60 CPUs. \n\nYou can create GPU droplets as well.\n\nOther think is about almost 100% uptime. Initially there some speed issues over the past. It could kick in once or twice in a month. But I think DigitalOcean has worked on this. I created an uptime monitoring service  (which also is from DigitalOcean). It says, last outage was around 175 days ago. That is very nice.\n\nIt's website is neatly structured. Great ease of use.\n\nCustomer support is also very good. Very responsive. I am using the free plan. In this plan, they reply you within 24 hours. Every time I opened  a ticket, they would promptly answer it.",
      "reviewDislikes": "I dislike a couple of things about DigitalOcean. Centos 10 was released on December 12, 2024. But it is not available yet in DigitalOcean as of today (7th May). Other providers like Vultr has it already. The selection of linux distributions is also limited. Compared to Vultr, DigitalOcean does not have that much choice of linux distributions."

The platform is beginner-friendly, the UI is clean, and setting up servers or other resources is straightforward without needing to dig through complex configurations. This simplicity helped me focus more on building my project rather than managing infrastructure.",
      "reviewDislikes": "One downside I've noticed is the lack of a free tier for cloud databases. For beginners or small projects, having a zero-cost starting point would make it easier to experiment and grow without upfront costs. Compared to other providers that offer limited free database options, this can make DigitalOcean feel less accessible for early-stage users."

Key features include Droplets (scalable Linux-based virtual machines), a fully managed Kubernetes service with a free control plane, and an App Platform for rapid deployment of web applications and APIs using PaaS principles. \n\nIt supports managed databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Kafka), object storage (Spaces), and block storage. Recent additions like GPU compute options (via the Paperspace acquisition) and GenAI Platform for building and deploying AI agents expand its capabilities for machine learning and generative AI workloads.\n\nThe API ecosystem is comprehensive, enabling automation and integration across a range of programming languages. One-click app deployment (e.g., WordPress, Docker) and clear documentation further streamline the developer experience.",
      "reviewDislikes": "While the overall experience is streamlined, I find that advanced configuration options can be limited in some managed services, particularly within the App Platform. Customizing deployment environments sometimes requires restarting instances from scratch, which may result in lost changes if not managed carefully. Additionally, migration to other public clouds is not always straightforward, and the process can be confusing or restrictive in certain scenarios."

There's also a lot of tutorials in blogs in youtube so it was then easy to use, implement and then integrate with my stuff. Getting some coupons for start was the key to me to migrate my services here, it felt like no risk and their Customer Support help me with a couple of questions. Security and Stability were another factors to consider, because of the nature of my frequent use of the service.",

It provides us with services in which we trust and place our work day by day, minute by minute since after the pandemic. Thanks to Digital Ocean, we are online with our proposal and reach our users throughout Latin America and part of Europe. We really feel very comfortable here and are not interested in changing providers in the medium term (nor in the long term).Before becoming Digital Ocean customers, we already consulted all the good documentation from the community, which has been and is very helpful to us, especially at the beginning of developments and when adopting new technologies.We have used customer support very few times, almost never, and we have always received the best attention, solving and clarifying the various issues.",
      "reviewDislikes": "We regularly use droplets and our development is quite punctual, so we feel that today and in the medium term it meets our expectations. I would like it to have more services like AWS does, but we wouldn't be taking advantage of them today. In the future, we might need some tools to scale or increase productivity, but technology is advancing very quickly these days, and it's possible that we will also be covered with the new features."

      "reviewDislikes": "Honestly, it's difficult to think of anything negative. Yes I've had the odd issue, but between their excellent documentation and their customer tech support it's never been an issue to the extent that I've experienced with other providers.\nThere's a few extra's that I would like to see like domain registration, all in all a good place to be for a developer"

      "reviewTitle": "Best affordable Cloud Provider",
      "reviewLikes": "I'm working on a startup together with a friend. We haven't gone live yet, but I feel compelled to give an honest review of DigitalOcean after having used their droplets for almost 4 months now.\n\nWell, just like most startups, we have a tight budget yet need massive resources to run a video sharing MERN app.\nWe first tried AWS, but that was way out of out budget. After a lot of research, we came across DigitalOcean, tried their droplets for three months using their free trial and haven't looked back.\n\nWhat I love most is how easy it is to manage our kubernetes cluster without worrying about how much we'll pay at the end of the month. All we  needed to do is select how many droplets we needed based on number of vCPUs, RAM, and disk storage, and we're guaranteed to pay only for those droplets . The only other cost is space storage, persistent storage, and load balancer, all of which are also so easy to estimate and cheap.\n\nTheir customer service is also really good, and they'll respond even during weekends. But you have to be very clear on what you need help on so they can assist you with the fewest number of messages since they do not respond immediately. But they also offer premium customer service options if you need immediate responses. \n\nAnother option is BobCares, which they do promote on their site also. It's a third-party customer service for kubernetes which I've used before and didn't like it at all. First, they're pretty expensive - about $99 per hour - and you're not guaranteed they'll solve your issue. Second, you have to give them access to your kubernetes cluster, which could be a potential source of a security breach for your cluster. \n\nFor someone who didn't know how to spin up a kubernetes cluster from scratch for a MERN app, I'd say choosing DigitalOcean was my best decision ever. I have control over everything and have an amazing group of specialists waiting to help any time I get stuck.\n\nTheir online publications are also super helpful and very well documented. I can't talk much about their DigitalOcean managed kubernetes (DOKS), but if you're looking to spin up a kubernetes cluster from scratch inside droplets, you'll need their CSI driver, which is just as easy as copying and pasting it from their Github.",
      "reviewDislikes": "The only negative experience I've had is in setting up firewall for my droplets using their firewall dashboard. I noticed that anytime I could add firewall rules, my site got really slow. I'm not sure why and didn't bother asking them so I can't blame it all on them. I went for the alternative of setting up firewall using iptables, which works fine now. I honestly can't think of any other negative experience.\n\nSince I'm using Droplets rather than their managed kubernetes service (DOKS), most of the issues I come across are things I can solve since I have control over the entire kubernetes set up. That's why it's kind of difficult to address any negatives; I can't fault them."

      "reviewDislikes": "We would like juuuust a tad more permission management, specifically giving people permissions on a project-based level, so that we can isolate between prod and dev.\n\nBut as I already mentioned, we appreciate the simplicity and straight forwardness of DO, so I'd rather use what they have right now."
