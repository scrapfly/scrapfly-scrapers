      "reviewLikes": "I've been using Digital Ocean for about 7-8 years. I've recommended it many times. In terms of freedom, it's so far superior to my previous web hosting options (BlueHost, HostGator etc.). It's also brilliant in terms of monitoring (checking uptime for my droplets) and the UI/UX is generally very easy to use and navigate. Pricing is pretty straightforward and easy to understand. I save a huge amount using DigitalOcean versus previous solutions.",
      "reviewDislikes": "The biggest challenge is probably the onboarding and learning to get set up. That said, the number of resources and learning documents provided by Digital Ocean is unbeatable. If you don't know how to set something up, there's little doubt that you can found out, with a detailed walkthrough document."

      "reviewLikes": "I have been using DigitalOcean for about six months for my personal website, and the experience has been quite positive. I appreciate that DigitalOcean offers a more affordable pricing structure compared to Amazon AWS, especially since AWS has a pricing model that can be quite variable. With DigitalOcean, I have a clear idea of my monthly expenses, which helps me manage my budget effectively. The setup process for DigitalOcean was quite straightforward, similar to AWS, but what stood out was the abundance of tutorials available. These tutorials are incredibly helpful, guiding me through almost every aspect and simplifying the setup process significantly. I also value the droplet feature; despite facing some initial problems with specific template droplets, opting for a regular, non-templated droplet worked perfectly for my needs. The pricing is another major attraction for me, as it provides a cost-effective solution for a small droplet with the right amount of RAM and requirements necessary for a small website. Overall, these aspects make DigitalOcean a favorable choice for my hosting needs.",
      "reviewDislikes": "I find the storage services offered by DigitalOcean not very competitive compared to Amazon's S3. If I had to choose a storage solution, I'd consider going back to Amazon for that purpose."

This affordability is beneficial as it helps me save money while still fulfilling my hosting needs efficiently. Although I don’t consider myself a power user, I find the platform intuitive enough that I believe I can easily set up new machines if needed. Managing existing infrastructure feels straightforward as well. Moreover, using DigitalOcean to host my website has been a cost-effective solution, aligning perfectly with my financial needs.",
      "reviewDislikes": "I find the initial setup somewhat challenging, requiring an external article to guide me through it as the support or instructions from DigitalOcean were not readily apparent or sufficient for my needs. Additionally, I am frustrated by the frequent reminders about payments. They make me overly aware of the monthly fee, which becomes annoying since I don't need multiple reminders for this. I've mentioned this concern to DigitalOcean before, but there hasn't been any change, which suggests they are not listening to customer feedback effectively."

You know exactly what you pay for what you use, without hidden costs or confusing pricing structures like other providers.Exceptional documentation: Their tutorials and guides are clear, direct, and really useful. The community and educational content are top-notch.Consistent performance: The droplets have predictable and reliable performance. The SSDs and network work exactly as you expect.Developer-friendly: Perfect for developers who want to focus on building, not struggling with infrastructure. The APIs are simple and well-documented.",

      "reviewLikes": "It can be dead simple. You can get a Droplet running in minutes without having to worry about setting up an internal network, user permissions, etc. Just put your SSH key, and at the end you get a public IP address and a compute node. Selection of droplet combinations are also straightforward.",

      "reviewLikes": "I absolutely appreciate DigitalOcean for its incredible ease of use, especially since I'm not a coder or someone with a strong computer background. Despite my lack of technical expertise, I found the setup straightforward and intuitively simple, which is why I often recommend it to others. The availability of helpful resources, such as tutorials and a comprehensive help page, ensured I could navigate DigitalOcean effectively, even successfully building databases and setting up projects without prior experience. Additionally, I value the platform's excellent pricing, which is both affordable and fair, further enhancing its appeal. The performance of the droplets is remarkable, with impressive speed and accuracy, which aligns perfectly with my needs. Moreover, DigitalOcean's security features bolster my confidence in the platform. Ultimately, the ability to collaborate seamlessly on projects with my programmer friend, using integration tools like GitHub, is a significant benefit, maintaining efficiency and connectivity across locations.",

The ease of setup and management, particularly for Linux boxes, has been a significant advantage, enabling me to solve my hosting needs and empowering me to create more web applications. The dashboard is another standout feature that enhances my user experience, making management straightforward and intuitive. I also find the backups extremely useful, providing peace of mind. The support materials, including tutorials available online, have been helpful, and AI tools have made navigating them even easier and more enjoyable. Working with simple yet effective terminal commands and the integration with SSH, Git, GitHub, and Docker enhances my workflow seamlessly. The company's overall vibe is fantastic, with a simple and elegant interface that promotes fun and learning, ticking all the right boxes for me.",
      "reviewDislikes": "I feel restricted by the inability to downsize a droplet once the disk size has been increased. Even though I understand there are technical reasons for this limitation, it can be frustrating when you upsize for a particular need and realize later that it was unnecessary. This leaves you feeling stuck because you cannot revert to a smaller size. This constraint seems to go against the flexible and empowering vibe that DigitalOcean aims to provide."

      "reviewLikes": "I have been using DigitalOcean for over eight years and I love the simplicity and clarity of their pricing structure compared to more complex services like Amazon and Google. I chose DigitalOcean for its good price and for offering straightforward services without additional technical complications. I greatly value the ability to scale in space and CPU with the droplets, as well as having full control over tools and connections like SSH, MySQL, and git. This gives me the freedom to efficiently manage software maintenance and the deployment of my web app. I also appreciate the reliability of the service, with uptime that surpasses the providers I previously worked with. I can manage my droplets and create new ones or discard them when I need to, which provides great flexibility. DigitalOcean is a service I highly recommend for its uptime, competitive pricing, and the reliability it offers; I always recommend it to my clients.",
      "reviewDislikes": "The control of the access ports to the droplet. Until the last time I needed to make a change, it is necessary to ask support for it, you cannot do it yourself as a client. That takes away independence."

      "reviewLikes": "I love how DigitalOcean offers predictable pricing, which makes budgeting for hosting costs straightforward and stress-free. The initial cost for a droplet was just $5, which was appealing enough for me to dive into using it without second thoughts. Their user interface is visually appealing and intuitive, which reduces the learning curve and makes managing my projects a pleasure. When I started using DigitalOcean to host my personal website and prototype new products, the setup process was completely seamless, and it has become even simpler over time. I also really appreciate the App Platform's ability to connect directly to my GitHub repository, allowing me to make my website live quickly, which is perfect for rapid iteration and prototyping. DigitalOcean effectively solves my need to deploy applications live on the Internet without the complexities I found in platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which makes it an indispensable tool for my projects.",

      "reviewLikes": "DigitalOcean offers a stable and predictable infrastructure, ideal for those working with professional applications and needing full control of the environment. Creating droplets is simple and fast, and the server performance is consistent even under production loads. The integration via API and the dashboard are straightforward, allowing for the automation of routines such as deployments, backups, and monitoring. The cost-benefit is excellent for medium-sized projects and for developers who value technical autonomy without the complexity of larger providers.",
      "reviewDislikes": "The absence of native support via real-time chat can delay the resolution of critical incidents, especially outside of business hours. It would also be interesting to see improvements in the transactional email panel and more detailed network metrics directly on the dashboard, without relying on external integrations."

The available templates are awesome, adding significant value right from the start. I appreciate how straightforward it is to handle storage, with the ability to easily add on storage that simplifies hosting immensely. Moreover, the process is so straightforward that I barely need any documentation. Another fantastic aspect is the straightforward upgrading and scaling. DigitalOcean makes it possible to upgrade either storage or hosting with just one click, which is incredibly convenient. The clear-cut menu system enhances this ease of use further. In terms of software integration, I find it efficient with typical software options like Ubuntu and Apache readily available. Overall, DigitalOcean simplifies complex processes, making my work both efficient and satisfying.",
      "reviewDislikes": "I would like to see improvement with the process of adding on volumes with DigitalOcean. It requires some coding and manual configuration to make changes and recognize the new volume, which adds complexity. I wish there was a more seamless process where adding a volume would simply expand my space without needing extra steps to configure and refer to the new volume. Additionally, I would appreciate it if DigitalOcean was a bit cheaper."

The pricing is transparent-no hidden costs-and starts low enough to fit small projects or startups. Another plus is their huge library of community tutorials and guides, which makes solving issues a lot easier.",
      "reviewDislikes": "Sometimes the support response time can be slow, especially during busy periods. I’ve also learned to keep extra backups, as I once had a managed database update cause some data loss. And while it’s perfect for simple to medium-scale projects, it lacks some of the advanced features you’d get from bigger cloud providers."
