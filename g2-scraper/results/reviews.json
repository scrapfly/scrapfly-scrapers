      "reviewLikes": "I really like how straightforward DigitalOcean is. Setting up a Droplet (their virtual server) takes just a few clicks, and the interface is clean enough that I never feel lost. The pricing is transparent-no hidden costs-and starts low enough to fit small projects or startups. Another plus is their huge library of community tutorials and guides, which makes solving issues a lot easier.",
      "reviewDislikes": "Sometimes the support response time can be slow, especially during busy periods. I’ve also learned to keep extra backups, as I once had a managed database update cause some data loss. And while it’s perfect for simple to medium-scale projects, it lacks some of the advanced features you’d get from bigger cloud providers."

In minutes you can have a droplet running, without unnecessary complex configurations.Transparent pricing: There are no surprises in billing. You know exactly what you pay for what you use, without hidden costs or confusing pricing structures like other providers.Exceptional documentation: Their tutorials and guides are clear, direct, and really useful. The community and educational content are top-notch.Consistent performance: The droplets have predictable and reliable performance. The SSDs and network work exactly as you expect.Developer-friendly: Perfect for developers who want to focus on building, not struggling with infrastructure. The APIs are simple and well-documented.",
      "reviewDislikes": "Fewer enterprise services: Compared to AWS or Azure, it has fewer specialized services. But honestly, this is also part of its minimalist charm.Limited support in basic plans: Premium technical support requires more expensive plans, although the documentation makes up for this a lot."

It can go all the way up to $1630/mo with 60 CPUs. \n\nYou can create GPU droplets as well.\n\nOther think is about almost 100% uptime. Initially there some speed issues over the past. It could kick in once or twice in a month. But I think DigitalOcean has worked on this. I created an uptime monitoring service  (which also is from DigitalOcean). It says, last outage was around 175 days ago. That is very nice.\n\nIt's website is neatly structured. Great ease of use.\n\nCustomer support is also very good. Very responsive. I am using the free plan. In this plan, they reply you within 24 hours. Every time I opened  a ticket, they would promptly answer it.",

This simplicity helped me focus more on building my project rather than managing infrastructure.",

For beginners or small projects, having a zero-cost starting point would make it easier to experiment and grow without upfront costs.

Recent additions like GPU compute options (via the Paperspace acquisition) and GenAI Platform for building and deploying AI agents expand its capabilities for machine learning and generative AI workloads.\n\nThe API ecosystem is comprehensive, enabling automation and integration across a range of programming languages. One-click app deployment (e.g., WordPress, Docker) and clear documentation further streamline the developer experience.",
      "reviewDislikes": "While the overall experience is streamlined, I find that advanced configuration options can be limited in some managed services, particularly within the App Platform. Customizing deployment environments sometimes requires restarting instances from scratch, which may result in lost changes if not managed carefully. Additionally, migration to other public clouds is not always straightforward, and the process can be confusing or restrictive in certain scenarios."

      "reviewLikes": "I'm working on a startup together with a friend. We haven't gone live yet, but I feel compelled to give an honest review of DigitalOcean after having used their droplets for almost 4 months now.\n\nWell, just like most startups, we have a tight budget yet need massive resources to run a video sharing MERN app.\nWe first tried AWS, but that was way out of out budget. After a lot of research, we came across DigitalOcean, tried their droplets for three months using their free trial and haven't looked back.\n\nWhat I love most is how easy it is to manage our kubernetes cluster without worrying about how much we'll pay at the end of the month. All we  needed to do is select how many droplets we needed based on number of vCPUs, RAM, and disk storage, and we're guaranteed to pay only for those droplets . The only other cost is space storage, persistent storage, and load balancer, all of which are also so easy to estimate and cheap.\n\nTheir customer service is also really good, and they'll respond even during weekends. But you have to be very clear on what you need help on so they can assist you with the fewest number of messages since they do not respond immediately. But they also offer premium customer service options if you need immediate responses. \n\nAnother option is BobCares, which they do promote on their site also. It's a third-party customer service for kubernetes which I've used before and didn't like it at all. First, they're pretty expensive - about $99 per hour - and you're not guaranteed they'll solve your issue. Second, you have to give them access to your kubernetes cluster, which could be a potential source of a security breach for your cluster. \n\nFor someone who didn't know how to spin up a kubernetes cluster from scratch for a MERN app, I'd say choosing DigitalOcean was my best decision ever. I have control over everything and have an amazing group of specialists waiting to help any time I get stuck.\n\nTheir online publications are also super helpful and very well documented. I can't talk much about their DigitalOcean managed kubernetes (DOKS), but if you're looking to spin up a kubernetes cluster from scratch inside droplets, you'll need their CSI driver, which is just as easy as copying and pasting it from their Github.",
      "reviewDislikes": "The only negative experience I've had is in setting up firewall for my droplets using their firewall dashboard. I noticed that anytime I could add firewall rules, my site got really slow. I'm not sure why and didn't bother asking them so I can't blame it all on them. I went for the alternative of setting up firewall using iptables, which works fine now. I honestly can't think of any other negative experience.\n\nSince I'm using Droplets rather than their managed kubernetes service (DOKS), most of the issues I come across are things I can solve since I have control over the entire kubernetes set up. That's why it's kind of difficult to address any negatives; I can't fault them."

      "reviewLikes": "It strikes the best balance of provided services and low complexity for SMBs. We don't have dedicated SREs, we don't wanna spend countless hours setting up IAMs, dozens of configs just to do the simplest of things, or trying to figure out what services is the best.\n\nIf you're looking for simple to use and straightfoward servers, DBs, containers, DNS management, S3 buckets, etc, the Digital Ocean is a great solution.",
      "reviewDislikes": "We would like juuuust a tad more permission management, specifically giving people permissions on a project-based level, so that we can isolate between prod and dev.\n\nBut as I already mentioned, we appreciate the simplicity and straight forwardness of DO, so I'd rather use what they have right now."

      "reviewLikes": "I've been with DigitalOcean for almost 10 years and extremely happy with their services, which don't overwhelm you with options and are a great value. Customer support when needed is excellent and they have lots of self-help support in the form of how-to documents and examples.",
      "reviewDislikes": "So far I have no complaints, they meet my needs perfectly. If I was with a larger Enterprise or government Institution they might be a harder sell as they don't have the same credibility as a Microsoft or Amazon, but for what most people need digital ocean is great."

      "reviewDislikes": "In the past they only offered droplets which was kinda limiting, but now they offer a wide array of services so I don't think there's anything that I dislike about it."

I have Digital Ocea to manage some Docker packages, including my web hosting service.  I more recently started to explore the deployment of some AI platforms, but I'd rather purchase my hardware to develop in-house, and then deploy to the Cloud when it is production ready.",
      "reviewDislikes": "Their offerings don't compare to something like AWS, but for small and medium-sized businesses they have a nice platform that keeps improving."
