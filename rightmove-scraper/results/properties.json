    "description": "SUBSTANTIAL DWELLING PERFECT FOR TWO FAMILIES, MULTI GENERATIONAL LIVING OR LETTING EITHER LONG OR SHORT TERM<br /><br />Situated in a lovely rural location midway between Truro and the A30. <br /><br />Either one very large property or as it is, currently split into two dwellings known as Tolcarne Bungalow and Middle Tolcarne Bungalow. <br /><br />Over 3,600 square feet of accommodation and a double garage, ample parking and gardens.<br /><br />Sold with no onward chain.  <br /><br />Tolcarne Bungalow 59 D - 72 C <br />Middle Tolcarne Bungalow 40 E - 54 E<br /><br /><b>General Comments</b> - The two properties known as Tolcarne Bungalow and Middle Tolcarne Bungalow offer a truly unique opportunity for a range of potential buyers. This could be used as one large family home, ideal for multi generational living or even for two families looking to live within close proximity for dependant family members. The properties are currently utilised as one dwelling as a main residence with the other let on a long term basis, this could be continued or alternatively let for short term holidays helping to supplement an income. There are many possibilities and a viewing will be imperative to understand and appreciate the accommodation available.<br /><br />Furthermore the property occupies a level plot of approx half an acre with ample parking, a double garage and a lawned garden to the rear with mature boundaries.<br /><br /><b>The Property</b> - Tolcarne Bungalow is the smaller of the two properties with beautifully presented accommodation arranged over two floors which includes an entrance porch, kitchen, dining room, lounge, four bedrooms and a bathroom. <br /><br />Middle Tolcarne Bungalow offers commodious accommodation again over two floors and offering huge versatility. It is fair to say that Middle Tolcarne Bungalow is now in need of updating and refurbishment although it does offer huge potential. In all comprising a porch, hall, reception room, kitchen/breakfast room, utility, study, two bathrooms, lounge and five or six bedrooms.<br /><br /><b>Location</b> - The parish of St. Allen is predominantly a farming area and hence the countryside is notably unspoilt and undeveloped. Tolcarne is just a short distance from the main A30 and hence easily accessible to all parts of the County and further afield. The nearest villages of any size are Zelah and Trispen (about one mile and two miles respectively) and together these villages provide local facilities including parish church, school, pubs, post office and shop. St. Allen itself has a parish church. The city of Truro is about six miles away and the north Cornish coast at Perranporth is just 15 minutes driving distance.<br /><br /><b>Truro</b> - Truro is renowned for its excellent shopping centre, fine selection of restaurants, bars, private and state schools and main line railway link to London (Paddington).
