They upgraded us when we got there free of cost. The room was immaculately clean and they came and cleaned early when we weren’t there. They helped up get a ride to the airport early in the morning. The pools are spectacular. It’s near a lot of restaurants and grocery stores, and is just a 5 minute walk from the Valletta ferry.

We booked our airport taxi (€20) via this and reserved sunbeds and made dinner reservations. Breakfast was fresh and delicious every day. Never too busy.

The noise levels are obscene. We have never stayed in hotels with such thin walls. We could hear every phone call, every step in rooms above us, and even so much as the toilets flushing in the room next door. We were also placed next to the lift (409) and had constant noise from this to add to it. In addition, there is awful building works going on across the road (less than 10m away). This was obscenely loud and went on from very early on until fairly late. So, you have constant noise. We raised this and was told the manager would contact us “if there was an issue that existed”, but never said anything. This is poor as there is no way they are unaware of the issues. Other guests also complained about the same thing. Therefore, despite the lovely amenities, I would absolutely NOT reccomend staying in this hotel because of the noise and the poor way management dealt with it. Had we been booked in for longer, we likely would’ve cancelled this.",

      "text": "This review is late, but very very needed. I LOVE THIS HOTEL... I don't care what any other review says, this is the best hotel in Malta, in fact, when I come back I will only stay at 1926. From the second I arrived to the airport I was greeted with such hospitality by my driver who picked me and took me to the hotel. When I checked in I met Christian and Alex who were both so warm and welcoming. I was in love with the vibe of the hotel  from the second I walked in -- the glass of prosseco also didn't hurt. I was really happy when I checked in as they gave me a free upgrade to one of their suites which was fit for a queen. This hotel is beyond amazing, they offer FREE tours and shuttles for all guest, every day, and had a beautiful turn down service every night. I came in decemebr so the beach club was closed, but the spa pool and sauna honestly made me not miss it. One of my favorite parts of this hotel is the fine dining restaurant they have on the top floor, somiler Bryan was so amazing and knowledgable on his wines that it changed how I drink wine. And the chef and his team, the food was outstanding, I did the chef's course with the wine paring.. i don't remember nor care how much it costs, the experience was well worth the value. I cannot talk about this place without mentioning some of the managers and \"executives\" of the place, especially Sascha the COO who I met with another exect [sorry I did not catch her name] on my last night during their canapie night. Typically when you meet these type of people they are very stush and closed off. But its truly not the case with this team, while I am sure I talked their ear off, they were all so friendly and hosptiable. I love this hotel so much, that it has been almost 2 months and I still have the app on my phone, and cannot get myself to delete it. I was sad when I checked out of this place, as it quickly became my home in Matla. I absolutely love this hotel.PS. i know there were some comments about the construction outside, but the island has been in construction for 20 years. There were some workers outside of my window, and I didn't find them disturbing one bit. In fact, I enjoyed waving to them in the mornings as I sat for my morning tea. The noise was very low and I often didn't hear them. Plus if you are visiting Malta, you should be outside not inside ... so the construction shouldn't both you one bit. Again, I love this place and look forward to booking my next stay upon my next visit to Malta.",

      "text": "We booked 1926 Le Soleil spontaneously while already in Malta and unfortunately encountered a bit of a booking issue at the beginning. However, this was resolved in the most professional and heartfelt way by the hotel manager, Olga, whom we would like to especially commend. Thanks to her, we received a fantastic upgrade to the “Sunny Suite” with a corner balcony and beautiful sea view – truly one of the highlights of our trip.The hotel itself is full of thoughtful features: the rooftop pool with heated water and the most comfortable loungers we’ve ever experienced offered true relaxation. The indoor pool, sauna, steam bath, and modern gym provide a top-level wellness experience.The in-house restaurant “Margaux” is also highly recommended – the food is delicious, especially the steaks, and the prices are very fair for the quality offered.A minor downside was that the air conditioning was still on winter mode during our stay in April. Since opening the windows brings in mosquitoes (which can lead to restless nights), we were provided with a state-of-the-art fan, which worked perfectly – an innovative and effective solution.The staff throughout the hotel were extremely friendly, attentive, and always happy to help – we truly felt welcomed and well taken care of.The location is also ideal: right by the Tigné Point promenade, close to shopping and with easy access to the ferry to Valletta – great for both exploring and relaxing.All in all, we had a wonderful and memorable holiday full of comfort, good food, and amazing service. We’ll definitely be back!",

The hotel is located in a position set back from the sea, the photos of the beach club suggest it is facing the sea, instead it is located in a narrow alley a few minutes walk from the sea. The main flaw, incorrectly not reported on the hotel website, is that close to the structure there is a very noisy construction site in full swing (Saturday and Sunday included), so forget about a good sleep and privacy. The structure is quite modern, small rooms and not soundproofed, so beyond the yard you hear the noise of the other rooms, the corridor, etc .. I point out that the hotel bar closes at 11pm, and even if you are sitting down to drink a cocktail you turn off the lights:-) , just to invite you to go to sleep. I confirm, like other reviews, that the breakfast is high quality, machines to serve with Lavazza coffee, good choice of sweet and savory, fresh juice, fruit, yogurt. Beautiful rooftop terrace with a small sea view pool and restaurant (not tried). Overall I was not convinced, I would not go back.",

      "text": "I feel very disappointed after staying here for 3 nights and I can completely agree with the others who state that they have been mislead. The hotel is not on the seafront, not like the pictures advertised of the beach club. The hotel entrance is down a side street a few streets back from the sea front. The room we had was upgraded to a superior double. I would have expected a normal double to be of this size and standard in a 4 star hotel. It was basic however, on the plus side, the bed was big and comfy. The room was cleaned daily and we got fresh towels when we requested them.There was a selection of items at breakfast - cooked and continental which were regularly topped up. The orange juice was fresh and they had a selection of fresh fruit too.The bar served a large selection of premium drinks and the cocktails looked nice and good value with a happy hour. There was building work going on outside the hotel which was noisy but I think it could have been worse if we were on a lower level floor. The spa was a big let down, there was about 4 loungers and a few hard chairs. There was only one jet in the hydro pool which worked as the other two were broken. The sauna and steam room were small but adequate. The whole spa needs a massive revamp, it looks a bit grubby especially around the pool area. Don’t believe the reviews about Prosecco on arrival as the hotel does not offer this.The location of the hotel is good for catching the ferry to Valletta but overall, I think there is other hotels in the area which are more premium class for around the same price.",

It’s just a pool—no functioning jets, no hot tub, and the steam room wasn’t working properly either.To top it all off, the hotel claims the key code access system is “convenient”—ours worked once during the entire stay. We had to share a single physical key between us, which had the room number written on the key chain. Seriously unsafe if you happen to misplace it.All in all, poor communication, false advertising, and a total lack of value for the money. Would not recommend.",

      "text": "Overall very pleased we spent a week at this hotel. The location is ideal with easy walking to the shops, restaurants and ferries. The staff at reception were always attentive and friendly. The breakfast had a large selection and of good quality, I liked the fact you were greeted on entry and advised which table to use rather than wandering around trying to find one. We rarely had to wait for the lift. I was amazed that a complimentary tour was available in a historic bus with a trip to the Blue Grotto, Dingli Cliffs and Mdina. The beachside club was excellent apart from one staff member who was aggressive and rude when we had the temerity to drink water from a bottle not purchased at the facility, we didn’t know the rule but the message should have been delivered in a different manner. The bedroom furniture was far from standard and ideal with no wardrobes or drawers to put things away. A poorly thought out choice. There was lots of noise from very early in the morning from the updating of the building opposite including, contrary to my travel company info, Sunday. Ear plugs certainly helped and as we were advised before going it didn’t bother me as out all day. I recommend two trips, the Tuk Tuk tour of Gozo was awesome and you were picked up close to the hotel and The Sunset Cruise to the Blue Lagoon by Hornblower Cruises, much quieter at this time and sunset fantastic. Uber rides are inexpensive compared with the UK and if travelling with Jet2 I would forget the arranged transport (arrived early and got us to the airport too soon after lots of pickups on the way and terrible attitude) and go by Uber or Bolt. Overall loved our holiday in Sliema and very pleased I chose this hotel.",

Check in with Francesca was quick and easy with everything explained. No room key, access to room is keypad which is a great idea. The room (Premium suite) was simply stunning, bright, spacious and relaxing. Incredible views of the sea from the balcony.Every single member of the hotel staff were so friendly, attentive and would do anything they could for you, even making sure you had cool water in your room fridge. Rooftop pool was amazing, although getting into warm water for a swim was a little shock (it’s heated only by the sun). You don’t have to leave your sun bed for drinks or food, simply scan the code on your table to order and it arrives. The beach club/infinity pool is not attached to the hotel, it’s across the road off the promenade. It too is stunning, cold and refreshing with unbelievable views across the sea. Spent many hours in the water watching the cruise ships coming in and out. Again, staff here were amazing, attentive and very friendly. I have booked to come back already.",

      "text": "We booked a Junior Suite. Our arrival was all very courteous and pleased to find we had a 10th floor room which gave us panoramic and sea views which we had not completely expected. We had a balcony, plenty long enough, but only around 2ft wide, and no room to walk past  one of the small chairs. There is so much building work going on in the vicinity, I counted 40 tower cranes from our balcony, but work does not start until after 8am and finishes no later than 6pm, so no unwelcome disturbance. We used the roof top pool, although the booking system was not very efficient for this, and everything in the hotel is booked on their app, which they help you set up on your phone when you check in. The roof top pool is quiet, only around a dozen sunbeds, but they are fabulous and comfy and plenty of parasols which staff are happy to put up and adjust for you. Despite the booking system making it appear fully booked, when we were there on 3 occasions , there were no more than 4 other guests. The downside - the pool was too shallow to swim in, and if you want to cool down after roasting in the sun, use the shower, the pool is far too hot, like bath water.We also used the hotel's private water front pool, bar and sunbed area. The pool was great, able to manage a little swim, and  perfect temperature. Sunbeds were good, and parasols again put up by staff. It was much more congested down here , no need to book, just turn up and towels provided. Drinks available any time, just catch the waiter's eyes. Disappointed not to be able to bring own water, it had to be bought from the bar, no outside food or drink could be brought in. My big gripe was loud club disco music - it is not a club 18-30s hotel so why play loud thumping bass rubbish. Fortunately a couple of visits to Le Plage area they had someone playing the music quieter, and although not an Abba aficionado, hearing 4 of their songs in an hour was a distinct improvement.Breakfast was a good spread, with English cooked breakfast, continental meats and cheeses, fruit yoghurts, a choice of pastries and various teas and coffees from a machine. We only had one lunch, taken down at Le Plage, a decent enough burger and chips.Room was spacious, bed and pillows comfortable, a good size wardrobe, with iron and board, we had to ask for more hangers, but ended not unpacking our bags because there was not a single drawer - very disappointing. There was a room safe, and the room was cleaned daily, and also an early evening visit to top up on the complimentary tea and nespresso machine. One complimentary daily bottle of water as tap water not considered good for English palate. air conditioning worked well and not too noisy. Nice big shower, but I dont think the guys that installed it, put on a big enough slope, as I ended having to squeegee the water into the drain with my feet after the shower.We had a great complimentary bus tour visiting 3 locations on the island on a 1960's vintage bus, I was a little disappointed it was not the older vintage bus shown on their promotional pics, but you cant complain about free. I was disappointed that the night after was arrived there was also a free sunset cruise round Valletta harbour, which we were not made aware of, and the reception staff indicated it runs on a Wednesday - however after looking for it on their app it did not appear, and it was only the day before the reception staff told us it was not running that week. So we ended up booking one of the trips through VisitMalta.com.We booked a taxi through the hotel back to the airport, very clean, on time and cost Eur23 for the two of us.At round £200 per night with breakfast it was pricey, and I guess we got what we paid for. I have to admit  that paying that much, I was expecting a more usable balcony, drawers in the room, a less rowdy pool by the sea, and to be able to use water from the room or elsewhere by the pool, and not to have to pay Eur3 for a small bottle. I thought also to qualify as a suite it would be more than an ensuite room with a skinny balcony. On the plus side, there was the complimentary tour, and a panoramic view. Decent location near bus stops and Sliema Ferries with plenty of local restaurants and close to 2 shopping precincts.",

We very much enjoyed the aperitif offered on the terrace. I was sorry, however, to note that sometimes the customer is considered only as a tourist. Not being able to access the starred restaurant on the terrace (it does not accept children) we had dinner, on their advice, in the one on the beach / solarium. Spectacular view, bad food, to pass on to the typical tourist. Having to leave very early we were offered the possibility, first, of a takeaway breakfast (since we had paid for it with the room), then, of something quick to consume at the counter (a coffee and some croissants). Result: no coffee (machine in the breakfast room still off) a plate with mini croissants and leftover cake from the day before that, of course, we refused. Fortunately, a nespresso machine with pods was available in the room. Unable to book a Bolt taxi from our phone, we ask the reception to do it for us the night before, so we don't have problems early in the morning. A taxi arrives without signs, without a taximeter, with a driver who does not remember where he must take us and to whom we must give directions. In the end he asks us 28€, against the 10€ paid on the way (Bolt would have asked 8€ for the same route). I hope you can improve these aspects and be in every way the 4 stars you expect.",

Our room was dark and a bit on the damp side. While it did have an A/C controller, it didn't actually do anything. During meal times the room also filled with the smell of whatever is being cooked.As the hotel butts up against the adjacent building you have a lovely view into someone's home, (the alternative being a room on the front which suffers from high noise volumes and dirt from the construction site opposite). No sunlight penetrates the room and you need to go outside and look up to see if it's a sunny day.Staff were cheerful and pleasant, but with a few exceptions (concierge guy was very good) generally useless. One example of manyeach day we asked: Can I have some normal tea in my room as the cleaner only leaves flavoured bags each day? Each day the answer was: Yes, no problem sir, we'll bring some up. Each day nothing arrived The rooftop bar/pool area is very noisy from the construction site and rather small and the beach club down the hill and across the main road is also next to a construction site. All round this is a very disappointing hotel seeking maximum payments for minimum service and standards. To give you an idea, this is one or may even two levels down from a Premier Inn",

      "text": "I’m not sure where to begin… So the Hotel is situated opposite a building site for context. Upon arrival you are met with friendliness and the reception area is modern and well kept. However, our room was not ready and there was no where to wait so we were sent away for 6 hours. After getting up at 3am all we wanted to do was relax but we couldn’t. Not ideal.We had booked what they call a Deluxe Room and for that you get from what I can see a Standard/Premier Room but on a high floor. See photos of said Deluxe Room. This is anything but Deluxe! Very basic, only a rail to hang your clothes, no chest of drawers. Very very basic! Bathroom ok but run down.  Bed hard. Shower weak. We were woken up daily by workmen doing their work right opposite us. Work being a complete build so a lot of noise ! Zero privacy. Zero point in even having a balcony. See photos for the view!You have to reserve your spot on the very small paddling pool on the roof. Very comfy sun loungers but dirty glass around the pool, oh and a bright red crane right over your head as you try to relax. We tried the breakfast, it was good and a lot of choice. We also had treatments which were good. The people in the spa are lovely. It’s because of them I’ve given an extra star.We had a late flight home and like in normal hotels we asked for late check out. Firstly they told me I had to wait till the night before we check out to find out if it’s possible but would be €60. We then enquired and were told the hotel was full. A lie. I checked other sites and there was availability. We were not asking to stay in our room particularly but have somewhere to freshen up before our late flight. We were then told there were rooms but we would have to pay €150. The reception team were very unhelpful but offered to keep our luggage so we had no choice but to wander - again for 6 hours waiting for our pick up. Pool was full. No where to shower or wait. Another long day ahead.During our stay we decided to go to the bar and have a cocktail. We ordered them and there was zero alcohol in the drink! I mentioned this to the bar man who was very offended and reluctantly put a little more in the glass. He also told me they only put 10ml of drink in the cocktail when the standard is much more. A bit of a rip off if you ask me.We were looking forward to seeing the pool by the sea. Well this is not by the hotel. It’s a walk down the hill and along the seafront. Another run down area next to some rocks that they call a private beach. Over all I do not recommend this Hotel. Our little trip was to relax and our experience here was not that. It looks fabulous and lovely in the pictures but it’s not. Ok the reception area is well kept but our room was not and the staff could be vastly improved.There are definitely nicer hotels in Malta and I’m sure are run by people who believe in good service when this hotel did very little.I would say look elsewhere.",

The hotel were really helpful with everything we needed.Room was great and yes there is construction but generally there’s no getting away from it in Malta and didn’t find it bothered us. Being lucky with the weather they did open up the beach club which was a short walk away which provided towels etc and id ideal as there are few sandy beaches. The rooftop pool was also open which had a heated pool, note you have to book this on the app when you arrive as only few spaces but was well worth it and the food was amazing! My biggest feedback was not being able to book the spa (like you can the rooftop) it’s not very big at all and the evening we went it was just full of families with young kids splashing in the pool, even messing about in the steam and sauna and this was just really disappointing/not relaxing and so we avoided it for the rest of the week. Really handy having the usual luggage store and then you can change in the spa changing rooms / freshen up before travelling. Makes for a great base for Malta!",
