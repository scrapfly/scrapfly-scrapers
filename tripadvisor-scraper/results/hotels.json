The room and bathroom were claustrophobic. There were no drawers or wardrobes - just a rack with 6 hangers and a box. You couldn't enjoy a stay in this room. It was noisy - noise from the street, hotel doors banging shut & loos flushing.We couldn't try the rooftop pool or bar as it was fully booked and closed at 6pm.We walked down the street to the hotel's beach club/pool. This was good except that it was very windy.  Hotels on this side of Sliema get the full brunt of any wind (the Hotels facing Manoel Island are protected). Breakfast was ok - you have to pay extra for omelettes,  poached eggs.The staff at Reception were very friendly and helpful. I didn't like the idea of using an App to book a slot at the pool, spa or gaining room access.",

      "text": "Arrived around 12 midday and went to check in, we were told our alotted room was unavailable due to a maintenance issue, so we would be upgraded to a suite for one night, but this would not be available until 3pm. The next morning, we went to reception to see how and when we would move to our allocated superior room, only to be told we would have to check out by 11am and then check in again at 3pm. As we were already checked in, we said that this was not acceptable and we would expect to be moved seamlessly into our alotted room as no one had stayed in the room overnight so it didn't need cleaning it should be ready immediately. After waiting an hour we were moved into our allocated superior room, which was very nice. The other problem we had was room cleaning. We had to complain 3 times that our room hadn't been cleaned, which is quite a lot when we only stayed for 5 days! The breakfast was OK, but unfortunately, the cooked bacon, sausage, hash browns, etc. were always either cold or luke warm! On the plus side, we went on the complimentary vintage bus tour around the island, which was arranged by the hotel, which was excellent. Used the beach club once. It was OK, but not brilliant. It gets very busy, and the day we went, the staff wouldn't put the parasols up because it was apparently too windy! You can book sunloungers on the roof through the hotel app. Finally, we must send a big thank you to Santiago, who was excellent when our transport back to the airport didn't turn up on time, arranging a taxi as backup. Unfortunately, overall, I don't think we could recommend the hotel.Dear Peter,Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback regarding your recent stay at 1926 Le Soleil Hotel & Spa. We appreciate your recognition of the upgraded suite provided upon arrival and are pleased to hear that you enjoyed both the comfort of your allocated superior room and the complimentary vintage bus tour around the island. Additionally, we are delighted that Santiago was able to assist you effectively with your departure arrangements.We regret to learn about the challenges you encountered, particularly concerning the room change process, housekeeping frequency, and the temperature of the breakfast offerings. Furthermore, we acknowledge your comments regarding the beach club experience and the difficulties with parasol availability. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.

      "text": "Firstly the staff have been superb and the service excellent Issues are:To enter your room you are given a code on line, personally I think this can be a security risk so not keen. Even more so as my code didn’t work and kept having to get cleaners to let me in. I was then given an actual key which worked properly and this again due to great service. Also online is the only way to use the spa or the roof top pool. Again none of this worked ! It’s says available then doesn’t let you book and so you actually go up to the roof and there is space ! Only a few people at a time are ‘allowed’ there in a hotel with hundreds of rooms. I actually gave up and didn’t get to use facilities at all due to the system just doesn’t work ! I gave 4 days notice that I need a late checkout and was told to wait and then the night before was told I can’t have a late checkout. this happens so late that my plans I had made then had to be cancelled and changed !! Why  4 days to tell me that!I couldn’t use any facilities as either the  system does t work or so few places allowed !

      "text": "Hotel that has all the right cards to be at the top: location in Sliema, modern and well-kept style, rooms equipped with all the necessary comforts, customer care, great breakfast, spa and swimming pools. We very much enjoyed the aperitif offered on the terrace. I was sorry, however, to note that sometimes the customer is considered only as a tourist. Not being able to access the starred restaurant on the terrace (it does not accept children) we had dinner, on their advice, in the one on the beach / solarium. Spectacular view, bad food, to pass on to the typical tourist. Having to leave very early we were offered the possibility, first, of a takeaway breakfast (since we had paid for it with the room), then, of something quick to consume at the counter (a coffee and some croissants). Result: no coffee (machine in the breakfast room still off) a plate with mini croissants and leftover cake from the day before that, of course, we refused. Fortunately, a nespresso machine with pods was available in the room. Unable to book a Bolt taxi from our phone, we ask the reception to do it for us the night before, so we don't have problems early in the morning. A taxi arrives without signs, without a taximeter, with a driver who does not remember where he must take us and to whom we must give directions. In the end he asks us 28€, against the 10€ paid on the way (Bolt would have asked 8€ for the same route). I hope you can improve these aspects and be in every way the 4 stars you expect.",

      "text": "The hotel has a nice lobby, but this is just a facade. The room was furnished with what looked like the cheapest office furniture they could find. Our room was dark and a bit on the damp side. While it did have an A/C controller, it didn't actually do anything. During meal times the room also filled with the smell of whatever is being cooked.As the hotel butts up against the adjacent building you have a lovely view into someone's home, (the alternative being a room on the front which suffers from high noise volumes and dirt from the construction site opposite). No sunlight penetrates the room and you need to go outside and look up to see if it's a sunny day.Staff were cheerful and pleasant, but with a few exceptions (concierge guy was very good) generally useless. One example of manyeach day we asked: Can I have some normal tea in my room as the cleaner only leaves flavoured bags each day? Each day the answer was: Yes, no problem sir, we'll bring some up. Each day nothing arrived The rooftop bar/pool area is very noisy from the construction site and rather small and the beach club down the hill and across the main road is also next to a construction site. All round this is a very disappointing hotel seeking maximum payments for minimum service and standards. To give you an idea, this is one or may even two levels down from a Premier Inn",

      "title": "Underwhelming!! Stay elsewhere!",
      "text": "I’m not sure where to begin… So the Hotel is situated opposite a building site for context. Upon arrival you are met with friendliness and the reception area is modern and well kept. However, our room was not ready and there was no where to wait so we were sent away for 6 hours. After getting up at 3am all we wanted to do was relax but we couldn’t. Not ideal.We had booked what they call a Deluxe Room and for that you get from what I can see a Standard/Premier Room but on a high floor. See photos of said Deluxe Room. This is anything but Deluxe! Very basic, only a rail to hang your clothes, no chest of drawers. Very very basic! Bathroom ok but run down.  Bed hard. Shower weak. We were woken up daily by workmen doing their work right opposite us. Work being a complete build so a lot of noise ! Zero privacy. Zero point in even having a balcony. See photos for the view!You have to reserve your spot on the very small paddling pool on the roof. Very comfy sun loungers but dirty glass around the pool, oh and a bright red crane right over your head as you try to relax. We tried the breakfast, it was good and a lot of choice. We also had treatments which were good. The people in the spa are lovely. It’s because of them I’ve given an extra star.We had a late flight home and like in normal hotels we asked for late check out. Firstly they told me I had to wait till the night before we check out to find out if it’s possible but would be €60. We then enquired and were told the hotel was full. A lie. I checked other sites and there was availability. We were not asking to stay in our room particularly but have somewhere to freshen up before our late flight. We were then told there were rooms but we would have to pay €150. The reception team were very unhelpful but offered to keep our luggage so we had no choice but to wander - again for 6 hours waiting for our pick up. Pool was full. No where to shower or wait. Another long day ahead.During our stay we decided to go to the bar and have a cocktail. We ordered them and there was zero alcohol in the drink! I mentioned this to the bar man who was very offended and reluctantly put a little more in the glass. He also told me they only put 10ml of drink in the cocktail when the standard is much more. A bit of a rip off if you ask me.We were looking forward to seeing the pool by the sea. Well this is not by the hotel. It’s a walk down the hill and along the seafront. Another run down area next to some rocks that they call a private beach. Over all I do not recommend this Hotel. Our little trip was to relax and our experience here was not that. It looks fabulous and lovely in the pictures but it’s not. Ok the reception area is well kept but our room was not and the staff could be vastly improved.There are definitely nicer hotels in Malta and I’m sure are run by people who believe in good service when this hotel did very little.I would say look elsewhere.",

      "text": "We stayed at 1926 for a week over the Easter break, Malta was lovely and we were really lucky with the weather!Location wise the hotel is a short walk from the shops, restaurants and bars in Sliema and also the ferry to Valletta or other day trips, we even strolled up to St Julian’s too. The hotel were really helpful with everything we needed.Room was great and yes there is construction but generally there’s no getting away from it in Malta and didn’t find it bothered us. Being lucky with the weather they did open up the beach club which was a short walk away which provided towels etc and id ideal as there are few sandy beaches. The rooftop pool was also open which had a heated pool, note you have to book this on the app when you arrive as only few spaces but was well worth it and the food was amazing! My biggest feedback was not being able to book the spa (like you can the rooftop) it’s not very big at all and the evening we went it was just full of families with young kids splashing in the pool, even messing about in the steam and sauna and this was just really disappointing/not relaxing and so we avoided it for the rest of the week. Really handy having the usual luggage store and then you can change in the spa changing rooms / freshen up before travelling. Makes for a great base for Malta!",

      "text": "We booked 1926 Le Soleil spontaneously while already in Malta and unfortunately encountered a bit of a booking issue at the beginning. However, this was resolved in the most professional and heartfelt way by the hotel manager, Olga, whom we would like to especially commend. Thanks to her, we received a fantastic upgrade to the “Sunny Suite” with a corner balcony and beautiful sea view – truly one of the highlights of our trip.The hotel itself is full of thoughtful features: the rooftop pool with heated water and the most comfortable loungers we’ve ever experienced offered true relaxation. The indoor pool, sauna, steam bath, and modern gym provide a top-level wellness experience.The in-house restaurant “Margaux” is also highly recommended – the food is delicious, especially the steaks, and the prices are very fair for the quality offered.A minor downside was that the air conditioning was still on winter mode during our stay in April. Since opening the windows brings in mosquitoes (which can lead to restless nights), we were provided with a state-of-the-art fan, which worked perfectly – an innovative and effective solution.The staff throughout the hotel were extremely friendly, attentive, and always happy to help – we truly felt welcomed and well taken care of.The location is also ideal: right by the Tigné Point promenade, close to shopping and with easy access to the ferry to Valletta – great for both exploring and relaxing.All in all, we had a wonderful and memorable holiday full of comfort, good food, and amazing service. We’ll definitely be back!",

The hotel is located in a position set back from the sea, the photos of the beach club suggest it is facing the sea, instead it is located in a narrow alley a few minutes walk from the sea. The main flaw, incorrectly not reported on the hotel website, is that close to the structure there is a very noisy construction site in full swing (Saturday and Sunday included), so forget about a good sleep and privacy. The structure is quite modern, small rooms and not soundproofed, so beyond the yard you hear the noise of the other rooms, the corridor, etc .. I point out that the hotel bar closes at 11pm, and even if you are sitting down to drink a cocktail you turn off the lights:-) , just to invite you to go to sleep. I confirm, like other reviews, that the breakfast is high quality, machines to serve with Lavazza coffee, good choice of sweet and savory, fresh juice, fruit, yogurt. Beautiful rooftop terrace with a small sea view pool and restaurant (not tried). Overall I was not convinced, I would not go back.",

      "text": "I feel very disappointed after staying here for 3 nights and I can completely agree with the others who state that they have been mislead. The hotel is not on the seafront, not like the pictures advertised of the beach club. The hotel entrance is down a side street a few streets back from the sea front. The room we had was upgraded to a superior double. I would have expected a normal double to be of this size and standard in a 4 star hotel. It was basic however, on the plus side, the bed was big and comfy. The room was cleaned daily and we got fresh towels when we requested them.There was a selection of items at breakfast - cooked and continental which were regularly topped up. The orange juice was fresh and they had a selection of fresh fruit too.The bar served a large selection of premium drinks and the cocktails looked nice and good value with a happy hour. There was building work going on outside the hotel which was noisy but I think it could have been worse if we were on a lower level floor. The spa was a big let down, there was about 4 loungers and a few hard chairs. There was only one jet in the hydro pool which worked as the other two were broken. The sauna and steam room were small but adequate. The whole spa needs a massive revamp, it looks a bit grubby especially around the pool area. Don’t believe the reviews about Prosecco on arrival as the hotel does not offer this.The location of the hotel is good for catching the ferry to Valletta but overall, I think there is other hotels in the area which are more premium class for around the same price.",

Lovely roof top pool with loungers and gazebos but has to be booked in Advance. Best part for us was the beach club a short walk down the street. Wonderful pool! Plenty of loungers. Not too overcrowded. Even had steps at the side of the pool into the sea so you could take a dip. Beach club - No cost to hotel guests apart from food and drink but reasonable prices and v good food. Beach towels available. Overall great holiday and would go back again. Thank you 1926.",

      "text": "Overall very pleased we spent a week at this hotel. The location is ideal with easy walking to the shops, restaurants and ferries. The staff at reception were always attentive and friendly. The breakfast had a large selection and of good quality, I liked the fact you were greeted on entry and advised which table to use rather than wandering around trying to find one. We rarely had to wait for the lift. I was amazed that a complimentary tour was available in a historic bus with a trip to the Blue Grotto, Dingli Cliffs and Mdina. The beachside club was excellent apart from one staff member who was aggressive and rude when we had the temerity to drink water from a bottle not purchased at the facility, we didn’t know the rule but the message should have been delivered in a different manner. The bedroom furniture was far from standard and ideal with no wardrobes or drawers to put things away. A poorly thought out choice. There was lots of noise from very early in the morning from the updating of the building opposite including, contrary to my travel company info, Sunday. Ear plugs certainly helped and as we were advised before going it didn’t bother me as out all day. I recommend two trips, the Tuk Tuk tour of Gozo was awesome and you were picked up close to the hotel and The Sunset Cruise to the Blue Lagoon by Hornblower Cruises, much quieter at this time and sunset fantastic. Uber rides are inexpensive compared with the UK and if travelling with Jet2 I would forget the arranged transport (arrived early and got us to the airport too soon after lots of pickups on the way and terrible attitude) and go by Uber or Bolt. Overall loved our holiday in Sliema and very pleased I chose this hotel.",

The room (Premium suite) was simply stunning, bright, spacious and relaxing. Incredible views of the sea from the balcony.Every single member of the hotel staff were so friendly, attentive and would do anything they could for you, even making sure you had cool water in your room fridge. Rooftop pool was amazing, although getting into warm water for a swim was a little shock (it’s heated only by the sun). You don’t have to leave your sun bed for drinks or food, simply scan the code on your table to order and it arrives. The beach club/infinity pool is not attached to the hotel, it’s across the road off the promenade. It too is stunning, cold and refreshing with unbelievable views across the sea.

      "text": "We booked a Junior Suite. Our arrival was all very courteous and pleased to find we had a 10th floor room which gave us panoramic and sea views which we had not completely expected. We had a balcony, plenty long enough, but only around 2ft wide, and no room to walk past  one of the small chairs. There is so much building work going on in the vicinity, I counted 40 tower cranes from our balcony, but work does not start until after 8am and finishes no later than 6pm, so no unwelcome disturbance. We used the roof top pool, although the booking system was not very efficient for this, and everything in the hotel is booked on their app, which they help you set up on your phone when you check in. The roof top pool is quiet, only around a dozen sunbeds, but they are fabulous and comfy and plenty of parasols which staff are happy to put up and adjust for you. Despite the booking system making it appear fully booked, when we were there on 3 occasions , there were no more than 4 other guests. The downside - the pool was too shallow to swim in, and if you want to cool down after roasting in the sun, use the shower, the pool is far too hot, like bath water.We also used the hotel's private water front pool, bar and sunbed area. The pool was great, able to manage a little swim, and  perfect temperature. Sunbeds were good, and parasols again put up by staff. It was much more congested down here , no need to book, just turn up and towels provided. Drinks available any time, just catch the waiter's eyes. Disappointed not to be able to bring own water, it had to be bought from the bar, no outside food or drink could be brought in. My big gripe was loud club disco music - it is not a club 18-30s hotel so why play loud thumping bass rubbish. Fortunately a couple of visits to Le Plage area they had someone playing the music quieter, and although not an Abba aficionado, hearing 4 of their songs in an hour was a distinct improvement.Breakfast was a good spread, with English cooked breakfast, continental meats and cheeses, fruit yoghurts, a choice of pastries and various teas and coffees from a machine. We only had one lunch, taken down at Le Plage, a decent enough burger and chips.Room was spacious, bed and pillows comfortable, a good size wardrobe, with iron and board, we had to ask for more hangers, but ended not unpacking our bags because there was not a single drawer - very disappointing. There was a room safe, and the room was cleaned daily, and also an early evening visit to top up on the complimentary tea and nespresso machine. One complimentary daily bottle of water as tap water not considered good for English palate. air conditioning worked well and not too noisy. Nice big shower, but I dont think the guys that installed it, put on a big enough slope, as I ended having to squeegee the water into the drain with my feet after the shower.We had a great complimentary bus tour visiting 3 locations on the island on a 1960's vintage bus, I was a little disappointed it was not the older vintage bus shown on their promotional pics, but you cant complain about free. I was disappointed that the night after was arrived there was also a free sunset cruise round Valletta harbour, which we were not made aware of, and the reception staff indicated it runs on a Wednesday - however after looking for it on their app it did not appear, and it was only the day before the reception staff told us it was not running that week. So we ended up booking one of the trips through VisitMalta.com.We booked a taxi through the hotel back to the airport, very clean, on time and cost Eur23 for the two of us.At round £200 per night with breakfast it was pricey, and I guess we got what we paid for. I have to admit  that paying that much, I was expecting a more usable balcony, drawers in the room, a less rowdy pool by the sea, and to be able to use water from the room or elsewhere by the pool, and not to have to pay Eur3 for a small bottle. I thought also to qualify as a suite it would be more than an ensuite room with a skinny balcony. On the plus side, there was the complimentary tour, and a panoramic view. Decent location near bus stops and Sliema Ferries with plenty of local restaurants and close to 2 shopping precincts.",

The breakfast was very good, and the drinks in the bar also impeccable. Standard rooms were slightly smaller in size and equipment than we had expected and actually suitable not more than a weekend for a couple. The balcony saved us. The air conditioning only works when someone is in the room and actively starts it, and when the balcony door is closed. The latter was not always quite easy to get (the tired door). I did not expect to see mold in the bathroom when the hotel looks so newly renovated. We had to ask quite a few times for small things that the cleaning staff had forgotten to fill with, but I think they were under pretty much pressure, and we were always brought what we needed to the room.

      "text": "We stayed here for a short break, just 2 adults. Prior to our arrival, the hotel messaged via WhatsApp asking for pre registration and access to their website app where you can book a taxi from the airport to the hotel (it’s €23 through the hotel. Or you can go to the taxi stand in the airport and it is €20). We tried to get an Uber which would have been cheaper but the payment wouldn’t authorise through PayPal, as it was coming up as €13. Maybe Malta doesn’t use PayPal? The hotel entrance is very modern with nice decor and a calming environment. We were greeted by staff, who, throughout the stay, were nothing but friendly and helpful. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived. Check in is at 3pm and we arrived at about 11:30. We had requested an earlier check in which was approved, subject to availability. We requested this, along with a high floor and sea view, when we made the booking through Booking.com (other booking sites available…). Even though the room wasn’t available, the staff explained that we could still make use of the beach club which is about 100 metres from the hotel whilst we wait for the room. The beach club has its own restaurant and bar area. There are a lot of sun beds available. Parasols also, which you have to ask the staff to put up, down, move around. We were told that you aren’t allowed to take any other food or drinks in from outside and they need to be purchased from their bar. Large water is €4. Cocktails are €11. They have happy hour everyday 4pm-6pm which is a set choice cocktail menu, 2-4-1 on the same cocktail. The food is slightly pricey in the restaurant (brioche ham and cheese toastie with crisps - €14) but tastes nice. The pool area of the beach club is nice. Some maintenance is required on the pool as tiles are missing and the pool floor in places had bits on it, almost like it hadn’t been vacuumed. However, it looks out at the sea and there is access via some steps to the sea if you want to go in. There is no sandy beach in Sliema. It’s all rocks. Beach club opens at 9:30. Closes around 6pm. Once the room was available, you get the access code via the website app. This must be a new system as the doors to the rooms still have locking barrels in them. The doors don’t feel or sound very secure. Each time our neighbour went in and out of their door, it was like they were coming in through our door! The hotel have put a new coded system in but not upgraded the doors. Due to this, the rooms aren’t very sound proof and quite a bit of noise can be heard from outside the room. We booked the superior room which had breakfast included. Quite a bit of space available for us two. Enough hanging and folding space for clothes. Areas to store suitcases. Tea and coffee available in the room and bottle of water, for which, the first one is free but there after you need to pay for another. The shower was small and the water didn’t appear to get that warm. The plastic around the shower door was also damaged so water leaked out into the bathroom quite a lot. The shower also didn’t feel very secure. The sliding doors were wobbling. They came out of their guiders occasionally. The whole unit just needs replacing really. The hotel has Molton Brown shower gel and shampoo on the wall. We ran out of shower gel after the first shower so had to call reception to refill it, someone came straight away to do this.The air con system in the room is good in the sense that it does make the room cool but the conservation/eco system they have in place is ridiculous. The air con only works if all the doors are closed and you are in the room as it is motion activated. So when you want it on through the night, the air con turns off and the switch is too far away from the bed to just reach up and turn it back on. So you have to get up out of bed, in the middle of the night to turn the air con on again. And it appears to only be on for an hour. During our stay, the room was too stuffy and hot to not have the air con on through the night. The air con also doesn’t automatically come back on once you close the balcony doors. So you open the doors and the air con goes off but once you close the doors, you would think it would come back on but it doesn’t. On the topic of balcony doors, one of ours didn’t lock. Luckily we were on the 6th floor so possibly not going to get someone breaking in. However, not really the point. We had to chase maintenance twice to come and have a look at balcony door which resulted in not being able to open the balcony door as we couldn’t lock it again once it had been opened. It just needs replacing. The bed was large and comfy. The hotel have put a mattress topper on it although it was too small for the bed so felt strange having the pillows on the actual mattress and then the rest of your body higher up than your head. Either get a mattress topper that fits or get rid of it. One of the light switches was cracked and broken. The plug socket made my plug extremely hot. The USB charging socket next to the bed didn’t let me use my phone whilst it was charging. I didn’t really trust the electrics in that room in all honestly. I just think for a 4* hotel, it’s not great the amount of things that were broken, not working, not quite up to 4* hotel standard that were in our room. You have access to the gym, which is across the road. We didn’t use it but seemed very modern. One of the staff stated it had only been open 2 months.The website app is quite good. On here, you can make reservation for the rooftop pool, book taxis and get general information. We had to join a waiting list for the rooftop pool area as it only allows a certain amount of guests up there at any one time. There are gazebos available and sun beds with a parasol but you need to reserve your spot well in advance otherwise you are unlikely going to be able to get up there. That being said, we were luckily and just went up one afternoon and asked the staff if any were available (this was about 3:30pm) and a gazebo was available so we were able to have that for the afternoon. Bookings are 9am-1pm and then 2pm-6pm. So if you want to book all day up there, you need to make sure both times on your preferred date is available. Otherwise, you might get asked to move…Breakfast was a choice of pastries, cold meats, salad, fresh fruit, cereal, yoghurt, “full English” type food, toast, tea, coffee and juice. It’s open 7-10:30 weekday and 7-11 weekend. Sometimes the hot food was a bit cold if it had been out for a while. We used the app to book a couple of taxis during our stay. One to the airport from the hotel which was €23. Reception stated that it is room charge but it turns out that it defaults to pay the driver, who does have a card machine within their car. So once we arrived at the airport, we just paid by card in the car. We also booked a taxi to St Julien’s which is €12. However, there doesn’t appear to be a way of booking a taxi for the return journey so we were advised by reception to get a card from the taxi driver and contact them when we want picking up. We just called the hotel again and asked them to contact the taxi company for us instead, thinking it would be easier for payment as it would just go on the room. The taxi booking system seems like it could be easier. Upon our arrival at St Julien’s, the driver expected payment for the journey. We advised them that we would be paying the hotel as we were told by reception staff it is room charge. The driver had to double check with their boss which was fine and all okay. Upon arrival back at the hotel, we made the payment of €12 for the journey and thought nothing more of it. The next day, whilst en-route to the airport to go home, the taxi driver stated they have been informed by the hotel staff that we hadn’t paid for the St Julien’s taxi journey. Yet, when we checked out, we were told everything had been finalised, nothing to pay. If you are going to have a taxi booking service via a hotel website app, just have it that guests pay the hotel and the taxi service invoices the hotel rather than having multiple options to pay. Clearly just gets confusing. All in all, it is a nice hotel with helpful and friendly staff. Nothing seems too much of a problem for them - supplying us with additional beach towels for a boat trip. Lots of facilities available for use. Exclusive use of the beach club, rooftop pool area, wellness options. It’s in a good location with lots of restaurant, bars and shops a 5-10 minute walk down a hill to the harbour front away. However, with the problems and issues stated above, would give this hotel 4 out of 5.",
