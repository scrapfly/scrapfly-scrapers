If the restaurant couldn't handle walk-in groups of our size(12 people), they could have simply explained the situation after we have specifically told them we would like to sit closer. Even when we offered to wait or adjust. Instead, the host sighed, rolled their eyes, and spoke to us in a condescending tone as if we were an inconvenience. The host needs to take 101 on hosting",

It was really good. The pizza dough was soft and flavorful. There was a nice amount of meat on my pizza. The unique combination of toppings on my pizza that paired well together. The pizza was large enough to share or have leftovers for later. \n\nI enjoyed the bourbon with homemade ice cream. I would definitely return and try other food options.",

The server brought over a handheld Toast point-of-sale machine, took each of our cards, and immediately presented the tip screen (with 18%, 20%, and 22% pre-calculated options) before showing us an itemized bill.\n\nI tipped 20% and then asked for a printed receipt. That's when I noticed a separate line item called \"Cook Commission - 5%\" added to the pre-tip total. This meant my actual tip ended up being 25% -- but I had no idea at the time because I wasn't shown the bill beforehand.\n\nAt every other restaurant I've been to, you're shown an itemized check first so you know the exact charges before deciding on a tip. Here, we were essentially tipping \"blind\" without being told about the extra 5% charge.\n\nI find this practice non-transparent and, in my opinion, unethical. I hope the management reconsiders how they present bills so guests can make informed tipping decisions.",

Normally that would be a NO but today, that's okay. \n\n23 minutes come and go, people are leaving while other people are walking up and getting seated, so I ask, how much longer?\n\nI was told, you've only waited 23 minutes?!?! ***pfff***  it'll just be another 15 more minutes or so.\n\nNO.\n\nHell to the NO. Get over yourself. I get you think you're hot shit for working here but come the fuck on and at least try to pretend you know how to do your job. \n\nWe bounced.\n\nSo back to the food, I wouldn't know.

The restaurant has a laid-back, fun vibe with outdoor bar-style seating as well as indoor tables. We were greeted right away and seated quickly.\n\nWe started with the chips and guac appetizer, which also came with peppadew cheese. I will be honest, It ended up being way better than I expected. \n\nFor entrees, one person ordered the bacon burger with fries, another had the cod tacos, and I had the avocado and bacon burger. Everyone loved their food. Honestly, my burger was one of the top 5 I've ever had. Absolutely delicious.\n\nThe fries were just okay. The seasoning was great, and even though I usually don't care for fries with the skin on, the flavor won me over. They just needed a little more crisp, they were pretty soft.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely go back if I find myself in Seattle again. The menu had a ton of great options I'd still love to try.\n\nAlso, shout out to our server, he was super friendly and attentive. Great service all around. You should give them a try.",

      "full": "Von's 1000 Spirits - A Disappointing Detour in an Otherwise Lovely Weekend\n\nWe came up to Seattle from Olympia for a relaxing weekend getaway--dinner and a show at the Symphony just up the street. Unfortunately, our experience at Von's 1000 Spirits was a major letdown.\n\nTo start, our drink order was completely botched. We asked for a Mudslide on the rocks and a Sazerac with Basil Hayden. What arrived 20 minutes later was a Vanilla Vodka on the rocks and a Greyhound with absinthe--neither of which we ordered. Our server, Fernando, seemed to have a language barrier, so I made sure to enunciate clearly when reordering. The second attempt brought us a Sazerac (a very light 1 oz pour, no garnish) and a White Russian--still not what we asked for.\n\nThe cocktails were overpriced and poorly made. $18 for a Vanilla Vodka with a $2 upcharge for a Mudslide? $18 for Basil Hayden with a $4 upcharge for a Sazerac? These are tourist trap prices for drinks that didn't even match the order.\n\nFor food, we ordered:\n\nVon's Cacio e Pepe Pizza - This was the only highlight. Cheesy, melty, and nicely balanced with hot honey and pepper.\nLemon Garlic Prawns - What we received was a mixed pasta dish with rigatoni and lasagna noodles, red sauce, tomatoes, something green, and what tasted like a tablespoon of chili flakes. No lemon, no capers, no cream. It was inedible.\nWhen we asked for the check, Fernando said he'd remove the pasta. He then presented a $95 bill without showing the itemized receipt--just inserted my card and showed the tip screen. I asked to see the breakdown, and suddenly the bill dropped to $66. That's a big red flag.\n\nTo top it off, when I questioned the pasta, the manager--bald, tattooed, and with a confrontational attitude--told me, \"That's the way it's supposed to be.\" Not exactly the hospitality I'd expect from a place with a 4.5-star Yelp rating and $$ pricing.\n\nBottom line: I felt deceived and taken advantage of. Between the drink mix-ups, overpriced cocktails, inedible food, and shady billing practices, I would not recommend Von's to anyone. There are far better places in Seattle that respect their guests and deliver on their promises.",
