The fabric back-of-the-hand  will eventually develop holes and wear out, but the fingers and palms stay good for a long time.  I wear the same pair for 2-3 months, for probably 4 hours a day every day.  Great dexterity...I can feel the burr on the edge of a thin sheet of metal, and can pick up small items (rivets, machine screws ,etc.) without having to take them off.  Also I can manipulate my phone screen without taking them off.  A+.",

I like the latches on these because I don't have to worry about them popping open like you do on some of the boxes in this size category.  You can't beat the price or shipping speed for these tool boxes.  They are just the right size and hold quite a bit without getting too heavy.  I have several and I am sure I will order more.",

        "comments": "I bought a box similar to this at a discount tool store locally. I found that one of the latches was defective and did not close all the way. Thought this one would be better quality, thought quite a bit more expensive. I plan to store lithium batteries in it for protection against fire. This box is a somewhat heavier gauge than the discount one. The latches are a bit heavier too. I like the hasp in the middle, I will put a carabiner in it for extra strength. I was a bit disappointed that this one appears to have a plastic handle. Hope is has some steel reinforcing in it. The discount one has a steel handle. The recesses in the ends of this box are not as deep as the discount one, so aren't quite as secure to grab when lifting. Steel tool boxes aren't as common as they used to be -- mostly plastic these days. Steel is essential for storing potentially flammable lithium batteries. The ultimate solution is the Bat-Safe line, but they are extremely expensive. This is a good compromise.",

Recently, I decided to get back into 3D still photography, and I had a Nikon D610 in storage, which I decided to use, but it needed a lens.  So, I purchased a lens, got all the accessories I needed out of storage, but then I had to decide what to use to carry all this expensive equipment. Most of my life I've used Lowepro shoulder and hand carry soft bags. First, the interiors are dust generators (a great enemy of cameras), they don't offer a great deal of protection, and they get more and more expensive. I bought 2 of these Proto boxes (one for each camera system), and they are perfect.  A soft bag to hold what these boxes hold would've cost 3 times as much.  I don't have the dust problem and my equipment is completely safe, and easy to carry. I've worked in a local metal fab shop since 1976, and we would be hard pressed to build and paint a box as beautifully crafted as these Proto boxes, for many times the price.  My hat's off to Proto. These boxes are well designed and beautifully crafted and powder coated. As one other customer has said, 'just like the good old days.'",
