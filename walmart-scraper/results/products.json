The motion rate does an incredible job at making games and movies all run very smooth and clear. The size of the 43\" TV is great for my personal use and it fits in my space very well. There's only one thing I wish they could update yet. I would appreciate if I could use the \"Picture Clarity\", aka motion enhancer in game mode. I have to turn off game mode to use it, which is not really any work at all, and my ps5 has very smooth graphics, but then there's the Nintendo switch that can sometimes only do 30 fps or so. I'd like to use all the game mode features including \"Picture Clarity\" if that was possible. It's a very smart TV too. Pairing my galaxy s22+ with this is super easy. It really does feel like a premium TV. The best that I've had so far! Good job, Samsung!",

The sound is great and can be turned up quite loud with no need for additional sound devices.  The picture quality is great. There is a wide assortment of apps that can be installed and used on this device. Bally sports  created a new app and within a couple of weeks. Casting my phone or laptop is really easy and good quality. My favorite feature is the ability to control the TV from my phone.",

Bought this TV about 2 weeks ago and so far so good. I used to stick to the 55 inch in my bedroom but now I've come back to the living room to check out the 70\". The TV has good visuals and good sound. The remote could be a little tricky to work  especially the volume knows but with some practice you finally realize that  if you press on the button it goes mute and you have to touch the volume by pushing it up or down.\n\nI watch movies and TV with the frame rates set to look normal because I don't like the soap opera effect and the picture quality is amazing. \n\nI'm still debating whether I need a sound bar or whether the TV will be fine on its own. The interface is very intuitive and the remote responds quickly to input. \n\nThe bezel on this tc is super thin so that you almost don't even notice it. So the focus is what you're watching not the tv .. I'd buy this TV all over again. \n\nWe mounted it and it gives my living room a much more cosy lived in vibe. I love it! Next up my watch!",

I was able to get one shipped and sold by Walmart directly while they were in stock for $499. I paired my purchase with a starlight blue cover and matching controller. I couldn’t be happier, especially because the scalpers didn’t get my money. The ps5 itself is in perfect condition. Box undamaged and unopened. Extremely happy to finally got my hands on one.",

It comes with a game called Astro's Playroom pre-installed which is great because it shows you all the stuuf the DualSense 5 controller can do. It's also just a fun game to play to pass the time. You could easily spend a couple of hours at a time playing Astro's Playroom. I highly recommend buying the PS5 disc edition.",

These holes expose nearby wording which identify the contents as a PlayStation. Luckily, mine was not stolen, but I was also home to receive it. \n\nFurthermore, either my courier thought the holes made great handles or the holes allowed the package to become snagged on something. Either way, not only was the shipping box torn open, but this also completely ripped up the bottom of the PS5 packaging.\n\nI've never made a stink before, no matter how poor the packaging. However, when I spend $550 on a single item, I expect it to arrive protected....or, at the very least, in a box with all its sides. It's just common sense.",
